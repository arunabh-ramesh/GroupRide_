Yes. I can help you and your team shape this into something you can actually demo by the end of the hackathon.

Below is a concrete plan you can follow.

---

## 1. Define a tight MVP (what you will demo)

Minimum viable product:

1. Users can:

   * Join a “group” (ride / ski session) with friends.
   * Share their live location on a specific mountain.
   * See all group members as dots on a trail map in near real time.
2. Basic safety:

   * Show distance between you and a selected friend.
   * Last-updated timestamp for each friend (so you know if someone dropped offline).

If you have time later, add:

* “Ping” feature (send a “regroup at X” marker).
* Simple SOS button that broadcasts “I need help” plus location to the group.

Keep the first demo goal: one phone moves around (or via simulator), everyone else sees the marker move on the map.

---

## 2. Core features broken down

1. **Authentication / sessions**

   * Simple: Sign in with Google/Email (Firebase Auth) or even just “enter a nickname + group code.”
   * Groups/rooms: Users join a group via 4–6 letter code (e.g., “RIDE32”).

2. **Location tracking**

   * Phone periodically sends:

     * `user_id`
     * `lat`, `lon`
     * `timestamp`
     * `sport` (bike/ski)
   * Update interval: e.g., every 2–5 seconds while app is active; slower in background.

3. **Realtime map view**

   * Map centered on the resort/mountain.
   * Markers for each friend with name + time of last update.
   * Tap a friend:

     * Show distance and bearing (“420 m ahead, slightly left”).

4. **Trail / mountain context**

   * Base map: Mapbox / Google Maps.
   * Optionally: overlay trail data (from Trailforks or OpenStreetMap) if you have time.

## 3. Suggested architecture (hackathon-friendly)

Keep this as simple as possible:

### Frontend (mobile)

* **Option A (fastest cross-platform):** React Native or Expo.
* **Option B:** Flutter.
* Use a map SDK:

  * React Native Maps + Google Maps, or
  * Mapbox mobile SDK.

Responsibilities:

* Ask for location permission.
* Start a location watcher.
* Push coordinates to backend.
* Subscribe to group location updates and render markers.

### Backend

To move quickly, you don’t need a full custom server:

* **Use Firebase:**

  * Auth: Firebase Authentication.
  * Realtime database: Firestore or Realtime Database for live location.
* Data model example:

  ```text
  groups/
    <group_code>/
      members/
        <user_id>/
          name: "Arunabh"
          sport: "bike"
      locations/
        <user_id>/
          lat: 42.12345
          lon: -73.98765
          updated_at: 1731678000  # Unix time
  ```

This gives instant sync to all devices with almost no backend code.

## 4. Handling mountain-specific constraints

You don’t have to fully solve these, but you should show that you’ve thought about them:

1. **Weak / no signal**

   * Cache last known locations locally.
   * If offline, show a warning: “Connection lost — showing last known positions.”

2. **Battery life**

   * Use medium-frequency updates (e.g., 3–5s) and lower GPS accuracy when possible.
   * Stop updates when user leaves the group or closes tracking.

3. **Privacy**

   * Location only shared within a group while “session” is active.
   * Simple toggle: “Stop sharing my location.”

Mention these design choices in your pitch; judges care.

## 5. Concrete day-by-day build plan

You can follow this sequence:

1. **Skeleton + map**

   * Create app.
   * Show a map centered on a hardcoded resort/mountain.
   * Add a fake marker to ensure map works.

2. **Groups + basic UI**

   * Simple screens:

     * “Enter name”
     * “Create group” / “Join group”
   * Store group + user in Firebase.

3. **Real-time locations**

   * Implement location permission + background/foreground polling.
   * Push updates to Firebase.
   * Listen to `groups/<code>/locations` and update markers in real time.

4. **Polish and demo flow**

   * Friend list UI on side or bottom sheet with:

     * Name, sport, last update time.
   * Tap friend = zoom to their marker.
   * Add one “extra” feature if time:

     * Distance to friend, or
     * SOS / ping marker.

5. **Pitch**

   * Story: “Keeping riders and skiers together and safe on the mountain.”
   * Show live demo with two phones, one moving.

If you tell me what language/framework your team is most comfortable with, I can give you a more specific implementation outline (screens, data schema, and pseudo-code for the location sync).
